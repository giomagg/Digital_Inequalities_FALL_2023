# Digital Inequalities – SPRING 2023

This repository provides access to the code and the data used for the social media data analysis final project in the context of Prof. Jen Schradie's course "Digital Inequality: Participation, Production and Pluralism in the Internet Era" offeref in the Spring 2023 at Sciences Po Paris. 

## The project in a nutshel

In late September 2021, whistle-blower Frances Haugen disclosed private documents from Meta showing that the company was aware of the harmful effects its services were having on society. She was invited for a congressional testimony on October 5th 2021.
In late August 2022, whistle-blower Peiter Zatko raised allegations against his former company Twitter, regarding the latter’s deficiency in handling users’ information and violation of US legislation. He was invited to testify before congress on September 13th 2022.

The research idea is to investigate the differences in the discourses developed around the two whistle-blowers – one male and one female – to detect the presence of targeted gender-based harassment and digital sexism. 

## Repositories
The *data* repository comprehends the downloaded social media data, the dictionary used to detect sexual-harrassment (based on Rezvan et al. 2018), and other elaborations of the Twitter data.

The *code* repository includes the code used during the project: (i) data analysis; (ii) sexism detection algorithm training (trained on the Samory 2021 dataset).
